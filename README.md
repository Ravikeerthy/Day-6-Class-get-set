This repository contains practice exercises for mastering getter and setter methods in JavaScript.


**Class:** 
A class in JavaScript is a blueprint for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. It encapsulates data and functionality, providing a structure for objects created from the class.

**Constructor:** 
The constructor is a special method of a class that is called when a new instance of the class is created. It is used to initialize the object's properties.

**Getter:** 
A getter is a special method that allows you to access the value of a class property. It is defined using the get keyword and is used to retrieve and return the value of the property.

**Setter:** 
A setter is a special method that allows you to modify the value of a class property. It is defined using the set keyword and can include validation logic to control how the property's value is updated.
